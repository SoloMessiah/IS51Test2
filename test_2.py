The program will display and calculate the number of grades, the mean grade, and the percentage of grades that are above the average grades. There should be two functions. 

The first function will start with a for loop to count the number of grades, starting at zero, compare it with the average grade, and if the grade is bigger, increase the count.
Then it will return the count divided by the grades.

The second function, the main function, will open Final.txt file. From here, we will print the number of grades. Afterwards, we will calculate the average grade. Finally, the program 
will print the average grade and the percentage of grades above the average.
